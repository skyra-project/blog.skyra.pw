**Nekokai is Skyra Project's Anime and Manga bot**, they come with all commands you need to search for anime and manga from [AniList](https://anilist.co) and [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io), as well as an improved `/waifu` command, plus all and more commands that were previously prefixed with `w` in Skyra.

Thanks to the Slash Command UI, Nekokai now makes it clear which commands require or may take a user. Previously in Skyra, it was a bit of a mixture, since the parameter wasn't consistent. Furthermore, you can also select users by mentioning them without causing a double mention incident.
